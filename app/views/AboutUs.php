    <section>
      <h2>Why UniPulse?</h2>
      <p>
        Traditional event promotion methods like posters and social media often 
        <strong>fail to reach all students</strong>. Many events go unnoticed, 
        and sponsors struggle to connect with the right organizers.  
        UniPulse solves these challenges by being the <strong>one-stop platform</strong> 
        for everything related to university events.
