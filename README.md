# UniPulse

## Project Overview
UniPulse is a university event marketing and management system designed to streamline the organization and promotion of events within the campus community. The platform enables students, faculty, and staff to efficiently create, manage, and participate in campus events.

## MVC Architecture
UniPulse follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which separates the application into three interconnected components:

- **Model:** Represents the data and business logic of the application. It directly manages the data, logic, and rules of the application.
- **View:** The user interface that displays the data from the model to the user. The view is responsible for presenting the data in a user-friendly format.
- **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It processes user input and updates the model and view accordingly.

This architecture promotes organized code, easier maintenance, and scalability.
